# Dojo Statecharts

A statechart implementation for the Dojo toolkit. Heavily inspired/borrowed from sproutcore.
After using sproutcore for a little while I discovered Statecharts and while I dont claim to fully understand them, I could see the benefit of using them. I have started working with Dojo on a large application and wanted to use statecharts, but dojo lacks this feature. So I decided to implement sproutcores statecharts (as best as I could) into dojo.
